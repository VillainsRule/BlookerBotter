<h2 align="center">why blookerbotter?</h2>

blookerbotter is the most efficient botter set play currently released publicly, as it accurately handles the ratelimits placed by blooket. you'll hit around 15 requests/second, which might not found much, but remember that none of these ever fail. this will result in 937 every minute, and 56K+ an hour. if you leave this running overnight, you can hit 500,000 plays. if you use a second computer with a second blooket account (or really just any other IP), you can get 1 million plays a night. if you run it all day on two devices, you can get a whopping 2,700,000 plays. this is pretty damn significant and something that you probably won't see anywhere else...and it's all fun and games until Ben deletes your set :(

<h2 align="center">proxies</h2>

blooket apparently blocks most proxies that i could find, so i didn't bother implementing.<br>
if you care enough, open a PR.
